## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for `Jotster`, an efficient and adaptive note taker inspired by apps such as Notion. 

Jotster is built with TypeScript and TailwindCSS using Convex and Clerk for backend technologies. 

**You can visit Jotster and start taking notes at [*jotster.vercel.app*](https://jotster.vercel.app)**

## Upcoming Implementations
I hope to add either Markdown capabilities or OpenAI technologies into the enviornment in the future. Be on the lookout for that soon!
